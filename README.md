# ft_printf

In this project I build a simplified version of the well know function ***printf***
It's the third project I did at codam

## Project description

A function that:

- Accepts a formatted string and variable arguments as input just like printf;

- Can do the following conversions: d i u x X s p c %;

- Can do the following flags: - 0;

- For the bonus can do the following flags: + ' ' #;

## How to use
> This function can be used by the included main. Run the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kasderooi/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio/ft_printf
make
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra main.c libftprintf.a
